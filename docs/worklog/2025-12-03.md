## External Training Data Now Stored in Database
**Type:** Improvement

Migrated external training data (course_compare.csv) into the database. Created new external_training table with 33,640 records from 829 employees. All CSV compare functionality now queries the database instead of reading from a CSV file, making it more reliable and faster.

### Changes:
- Created `external_training` table with indexes
- Created `scripts/create-external-training-table.ts`
- Created `scripts/import-external-training.ts`
- Updated `/api/csv-compare` to query database
- Updated `/api/reports/course-compare-names` to query database
- Updated `/api/reports/course-compare-preview` to query database
- Updated `/api/reports/course-compare` to query database

## Updated Custom Reports Page
**Type:** Improvement

Removed the static "Course Compare Analysis Report" from Quick Downloads. Renamed "Course Compare Report" to "External Training Compare" with clearer description. The report now allows previewing individual employees and downloading the full comparison as an Excel file.

### Changes:
- Removed `staticReports` array entry for course-compare-analysis
- Renamed report title to "External Training Compare"
- Updated description to be clearer about functionality
