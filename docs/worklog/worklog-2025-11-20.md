## Fixed Expires Column Calculation
**Type:** Bug Fix

Fixed the expires column in the employee training records to calculate expiration at the end of the day (23:59:59) instead of the start of the day (00:00:00). This ensures that certificates expiring today show "expires in X hours" rather than "X hours ago".
